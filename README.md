# My Portfolio Website

## Synopsis
This is my portfolio website where I can showcase the best projects I've have been working on recently. It is responsive for any screen size and resolutions. I welcome any type of feedback!

**[Live](http://www.imjas.me/)**

## Installation Instruction
> to install the dependencies
`npm install`

> to run gulp (watch scss changes and transpile it to css3)
`gulp`

> in the bowser go to:
`localhost:8080`

## Cool bit
The parallax `Parallax is an effect where the background content or image in this case, is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.` effect that you get when scrolling down is one of the cool things I like on this website. It's was quite easy to implement using the materialize library.

## Angry bit
Getting things to aline took a while. Especially in the skills section.

## Tech
`html5` `SCSS` `javascript` `jQuery` `materialize(by google)` `Gulp`


## Future
One of the 'todo' work I want to add to this website is some more interactivity and some style tweaks.
